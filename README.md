## Synopsis

**impartial-youtube** is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script that aims at removing from the user's perspective some [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) '_features_' that, to [my](https://github.com/pldiiw) point of view, might influence an user's opinion and behaviour.

## Features

### Current

* Hide all views counts
* Hide subscribers counts ([not every ones right now](https://github.com/pldiiw/impartial-youtube#planned))
* Add a '_Show comments_' button

### Planned

* Hide subscribers counts when hovering a username


## Motivation

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) is awesome but it happens a lot when surfing on it that your attention get caught by a video because of its seductive, click-baiting title, and, when lowering the eyes on the views count, your most basic instinct makes you click on it.  
Hours, years and life are wasted this way. It may be a bit overstated, yes.--
Navigating Youtube without this central indicator in the Youtube world helps you focus on the content, and, build your own opinion on a video before being influenced by the others, which is generaly more sane and makes the world go forward.  
Speaking of others, the only rallying thing that is left with this script are the comments. Mainly, confess it, not idealy used by most people, they can be a source of spoils and, as stated earlier, early influences. But, for some videos, it may be necessary for you to read some comments or participate in a discussion. To get everyone to agree, thanks to this script, the comments are only displayed if you want to.

## Installation

The script was initialy wrote using Greasemonkey to activate it, but if you're smart enough you can find your way to use it under an other browser than just Firefox. If you do, don't hesitate to open an issue and tell your discovery, sailor.

### Firefox

* Install the [Greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* [Click here to install the script](https://github.com/pldiiw/impartial-youtube/raw/master/impartial-youtube.user.js)
* You're done
